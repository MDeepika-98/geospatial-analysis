# üöî Crime Incidents in 2024

## üìÑ Overview

This project focuses on the geospatial analysis of crime incidents reported in the District of Columbia for the year 2024. The dataset is sourced from the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and provides location-based details on various crime occurrences within the district. By examining this data, we aim to identify spatial patterns, crime hotspots, and trends that can inform public safety strategies and urban planning decisions.

## üìä Dataset Details

* Source: District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department (MPD)

* Dataset Link: [Crime Incidents in 2024](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-incidents-in-2024/resource/48eeb897-aa75-4d14-9f73-8765f6e7f93a?inner_span=True)

* Data Format: Available in multiple formats including CSV, Shapefile, GeoJSON, and KML.

## üìë Geospatial Data Attributes

* The dataset contains location-based attributes that enable geospatial analysis:

* X, Y: Coordinates of the crime location.

* LATITUDE, LONGITUDE: Geographical coordinates for crime mapping.

* XBLOCK, YBLOCK: Geospatial block coordinates for spatial clustering.

* WARD: Political ward where the crime occurred.

* ANC: Advisory Neighborhood Commission area where the crime took place.

* DISTRICT: Police district responsible for handling the crime.

* PSA: Police Service Area covering the incident location.

* NEIGHBORHOOD_CLUSTER: Cluster of neighborhoods related to the crime location.

* BLOCK_GROUP: Census-defined block group identifier.

* CENSUS_TRACT: Census tract where the crime occurred.

* VOTING_PRECINCT: Voting precinct associated with the location.

* BID: Business Improvement District identifier (if applicable).

## üîç Geospatial Analyses

* Using this dataset, we focus on spatial analyses such as:

* Crime Hotspot Mapping: Identify high-crime areas using geospatial clustering techniques.

* Neighborhood Risk Analysis: Compare crime density across different wards and neighborhoods.

* Geospatial Temporal Trends: Analyze changes in crime patterns over time using GIS techniques.

* Proximity Analysis: Assess the impact of nearby locations (e.g., schools, public spaces) on crime incidents.

* Heatmaps and Spatial Visualization: Generate visual heatmaps of crime incidents to better understand spatial distribution.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Considerations

* Geocoding Accuracy: Incident locations are geocoded to the District's Master Address Repository and mapped accordingly. Some discrepancies may exist.

* Data Updates: The dataset is updated periodically, and working with the most recent version ensures accurate geospatial analysis.

* Privacy Considerations: Specific addresses are generalized to protect individual privacy while maintaining spatial accuracy.

## üì• Accessing the Data

The dataset is available in geospatial formats:

* Shapefile: For GIS applications like ArcGIS and QGIS.

* GeoJSON: Useful for web-based mapping and analysis.

* KML: Compatible with applications like Google Earth for visualization.

* CSV: Can be used for data analysis and converted into geospatial formats.
