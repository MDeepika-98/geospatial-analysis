## üöó Crash Incidents Report - 2024
## üìÑ Overview
This project is dedicated to analyzing crash incidents reported in 2024. The dataset is sourced from the Crash Reporting System and contains detailed information on traffic accidents, including geospatial, environmental, and driver-related factors. By examining these data, we aim to uncover patterns in crash occurrences, identify accident hotspots, and inform traffic safety strategies.

## üìä Dataset Details
Source: Crash Reporting System (ACRS)
Dataset Link: Crash Incidents in 2024
Data Format: Available in multiple formats including CSV, Shapefile, GeoJSON, and KML.

## üìë Geospatial Data Attributes
The dataset includes key attributes to enable in-depth geospatial analysis:
‚Ä¢	Crash Date/Time: Date and time of the crash.
‚Ä¢	Hit/Run: Indicates if the crash involved a hit-and-run.
‚Ä¢	Route Type: Describes the type of road or route (e.g., highway, local road).
‚Ä¢	Lane Direction: Direction of the lane where the crash occurred.
‚Ä¢	Number of Lanes: Total number of lanes on the road at the crash site.
‚Ä¢	Direction: The direction in which traffic was moving at the time of the crash.
‚Ä¢	Distance: The distance from a reference point, such as a mile marker or intersection.
‚Ä¢	Distance Unit: The unit of measurement for the distance (e.g., miles, kilometers).
‚Ä¢	Road Grade: Describes the incline of the road (e.g., flat, uphill).
‚Ä¢	At Fault: Indicates whether a driver was at fault for the crash.
‚Ä¢	Collision Type: Type of collision (e.g., rear-end, side-swipe).
‚Ä¢	Weather: Weather conditions at the time of the crash (e.g., clear, rainy).
‚Ä¢	Surface Condition: Condition of the road surface (e.g., wet, dry, icy).
‚Ä¢	Light: Lighting conditions at the time of the crash (e.g., daylight, nighttime).
‚Ä¢	Traffic Control: Type of traffic control device at the crash site (e.g., stop sign, traffic light).
‚Ä¢	Driver Substance Abuse: Indicates if substance abuse was involved.
‚Ä¢	First Harmful Event: The primary event that caused injury or damage (e.g., collision with another vehicle).
‚Ä¢	Second Harmful Event: Secondary event contributing to the crash (e.g., hitting a guardrail).
‚Ä¢	Junction: Whether the crash occurred at or near an intersection or junction.
‚Ä¢	Intersection Type: Type of intersection (e.g., T-junction, roundabout).
‚Ä¢	Road Alignment: Describes how the road curves or bends at the crash location.
‚Ä¢	Road Condition: Condition of the road at the crash site (e.g., potholes, smooth).
‚Ä¢	Road Division: Whether the road is divided or undivided.
‚Ä¢	Latitude: Geographical latitude of the crash location.
‚Ä¢	Longitude: Geographical longitude of the crash location.

## üîç Geospatial Analyses
By analyzing this dataset, we can perform the following geospatial analyses:
‚Ä¢	Crash Hotspot Mapping: Identify high-crash areas using clustering and density analysis.
‚Ä¢	Road Safety Assessment: Assess risk factors such as road conditions, alignment, and weather for crash-prone areas.
‚Ä¢	Time-Based Trends: Examine patterns in crash frequency over different times of day, seasons, or weather conditions.
‚Ä¢	Geospatial Proximity Analysis: Explore the impact of nearby features like schools, traffic signals, or intersections on crash occurrences.
‚Ä¢	Crash Type & Severity Mapping: Visualize the severity of crashes and the type of collisions across different regions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Considerations
Geocoding Accuracy: Crash locations are geocoded to the nearest identifiable reference points, but some discrepancies may exist.
Data Completeness: The dataset is updated periodically, so earlier reports might have missing or incomplete data for some variables.
Privacy Considerations: Specific details about individuals involved in crashes are protected to ensure privacy while maintaining the integrity of geospatial analysis.

## üì• Accessing the Data
The dataset is available in various formats for different analysis purposes:
Shapefile: Ideal for GIS tools like ArcGIS and QGIS.
GeoJSON: Best for web-based visualizations.
KML: Suitable for use with Google Earth.
CSV: Convenient for spreadsheet-based analysis and conversion into GIS formats.
